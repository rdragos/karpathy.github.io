I am a 3rd year PhD student at University of Bristol 
working at KU Leuven under the supervision of Prof. Nigel Smart.
My interests range from multiparty computation, applied cryptography to algorithms and data structures.

In my spare time I have created a list with MPC resources both software and theory. Check it out [here](https://github.com/rdragos/awesome-mpc) and feel free to contribute!
