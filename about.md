I am a senior cryptographer at [Zama](https://www.zama.ai/) in the protocols team.

Previously I was a cryptography engineer at [Cape
Privacy](https://capeprivacy.com/) where I worked on
[moose](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/moose), a distributed dataflow framework
using secure computation.

In 2020 I graduated with a PhD from University of Bristol supervised by Prof.
Nigel Smart.

My interests range from multiparty computation, applied cryptography to algorithms and data structures.
In my spare time I have created a list with MPC resources both software and theory. Check it out [here](https://github.com/rdragos/awesome-mpc) and feel free to contribute!
