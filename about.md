I recently graduated with a PhD from University of Bristol 
supervised by Prof. Nigel Smart. I am now working at a cool [startup](https://capeprivacy.com/)
which does privacy preserving machine learning.

My interests range from multiparty computation, applied cryptography to algorithms and data structures.
In my spare time I have created a list with MPC resources both software and theory. Check it out [here](https://github.com/rdragos/awesome-mpc) and feel free to contribute! 

If you want to contact me please drop me an email to
`first-name at capeprivacy dot com` or a DM on Twitter.
