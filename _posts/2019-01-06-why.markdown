Why have I started a blog? The answer is pretty straightforward:
I have to write my thesis and unless you're [Craig Gentry](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/) almost no one will read your PhD thesis (apologize to Nigel and my committee!).

Since I am not Gentry and my thesis is not inventing the first FHE scheme
the idea of these posts is to disseminate my thesis into tutorials on how to do cool stuff using MPC.

I will start with some introductory material to run some basic (yet interesting) programs using SCALE-MAMBA.
Afterwards I will try to sprinkle some posts with some research bits I have done. In this way at least
some chunks of the thesis will be read by more than 5 people.
